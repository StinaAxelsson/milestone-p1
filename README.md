# Project Description 

<p>This project have I developed for my brother, who is the main character for this website and the person behind "Wizack Twizack". He is a Psytrance musician and i thought it would be a good idea to make a website for him, where all of his information is gathered in one place and therefore easier for his listeners and possibly future producers to get a picture of him as a music creator.

This project is developed as my first Milestone project assignment at the Code Institute course I take. I chose to build my project as a One-page scrolling website to make my content on the website more effective for the user experience.

# UX
This is what I have done for make the User Experience good.
## Site Owner Goals
1. Have a full responsive site on all different screen sizes.
2. Make the user feel interested directly when visit my site.
3. Have information on what the site is about easy to find.
4. Put all of the relevant information that is about this person the website is about, on one place so his followers, listeners and producers can find what they looking for in one place.
5. Keep a red thred throug the whole website.

## Design Choises
When I planned out the design, I was serching around the internet for some inspiration. My website is about a musician/DJ and therefore, I was looking at other famous DJs websites and found that almost every DJ had the same theme on their sites. So I used that as a template when developed this website, but of course with my own style and touch to make it stand out from the others, and made it so eye-cathing I possibly could for only using HTML and CSS.
## Colors
I used Wizack Twizacks lates album-cover as a theme throuh out the whole website. The color path I chose to work with was: lightblue, pink, purple, white and black. And feel like it goes very well together and standing out and easy for eyes to read.
## Fonts
I choosed to go with two different Fonts. 'Montserrat' for all of the text on the site, and 'Audiowide' for all headlines, navigationbar and buttons. I think that fit the theme and goes well with the design. Easy to read the text, and for rubrics its nice to have something bolder that catch your eye.
## Structure
This is as I have written before, a one-page scrolling website, so it follows that structure.
We have the header at the top, that contains the logo at the left corner and navigation links horisontally at the right with the "NEW, ABOUT, MUSIC, EVENT, CONTACT" in that order.
Down under we have the Hero section (NEW). Contains the image of the latest album that zooms in. Below the album you got a text that explanes what we see, and that you can choose to listen to it right now with help of the button links that will takes the user to a new tab when click.
Right below we have the About section, that tells the user who this site is about and give us the relevant information for the coming sections. We have a button that links the user to the contact form, if you wonder anything or just want to get in touch.
Below that we have the Music section starting. With another color theme and here you can see all of the album he have made, and if you hover over you see it change color and is clickable. When click at a album, you will be linked to a site that streams the music and it will open in a new tab.
Also, you can if you want listen to the top 10 songs right in the section with the embedded spotify widget.
Under the music section, we have the event section. That show us a table with places and dates when we have to expect upcoming events. With a map as a background so we can understand what its about. But for prevailing circumstances for Covid I put a textbox telling us that we are not sure if it will be possible to have the events.
Below this event section, we have the last one, the Contact section. Here you can just fill in the form with your name and email and you question or request and press submit and send! Easy and it also contain a little information text for the user how to do it.
At the bottom of the whole page we have the footer. Here are links to all social media and an email address to stay updated and connected. 


# Features
This is a one-page scroll website where all information is on one page, but divided into different sections.
## Existing Features
* <b>Header and Navigation Bar</b>
  * Placed at the top with a logo on the left with a link that takes the user to the home page when clicked on. To the right is a navigation bar that takes the user to the various sections of the website
  * Full responsive
* <b>The Hero Section</b>
  * This section is what the user first encounters when entering the page. It shows a photo of the musician's latest album that zooms in for 5 seconds.
  * Just below is a text that describes what you see, along with two buttons below that will link the user to two different places where you can listen or buy the album that opens in a new window.
* <b>About section</b>
  * The about section provides the user with information about who the website is about along with photos of the main character. 
  * Below the text about the main character, there is a button linked to the contact form on the website to be able to quickly fill in the form if you as a user are interested in getting in touch to, for example, book for future gigs.
* <b>Music Section</b>
  * This section contains clickable images on his album, where each album can be clicked on and you will come to a new page where you can choose where you want to stream the album. Under each picture, it says what the album is called and what year they were released. As well as a text that explains that there is more music to listen to, on his music services.
  * There is an embedded media player from Spotify with his 10 most played songs at the bottom of the section that can be listened to directly on the website.
* <b>Event Section</b>
  * This section is for listing the upcoming dates he will be playing on and I chose to do them with a form. It easily shows where and when.
  * The background is a map of Europe as it is in Europe that his gigs would be, to give the user a sense of what the section wants to give for information to the user
  * A text box with information about Covid and current circumstances under the event list. As we do not know yet if the gigs will take place.
* <b>Contact Section</b>
  * A form to easily contact Wizack Twizack with general questions or for future bookings. Where the user is required to fill in the name and email address, as well as their question and then click submit. 
* <b>Footer</b>
  * At the bottom is the footer. Contains icons for all social media Wizack Twizack is on. Clicking on an icon opens a new tab on the selected social media. Easy for the user to follow him on these social media and stay up to date.
  * Also an email address if you as a user prefer to send a regular email instead of the form. Along with a copywright icon that shows that the content on the website may not be used for external use.
* <b>Top button</b>
  * I have chosen to put a "Back to Top" button in the bottom right corner. As the website is a one-page scroll website, it makes it easier for the user to easily get to the menu quickly, instead of scrolling.
## Features Left to Implement
* In the Music Section, I wanted to put a media player under each album that the user can play the music directly via the website instead of just clicking and opening in the new tab. 
* Also in the Music Section, I was planning to make a carousel for the albums. But because I have not yet learned much about javascript, it had to be a grid with the album instead.

# Testing
For testing my website, I have used Chrome DevTools in order to see how it works in smaller screens and devices. It has been a great tool to work with and to find errors or bugs with along the road. 
When I started write code, I only thought of how it looked on my desktop screen. When I was done with the website and it looked goot on my desktop, I started to make it responsive and that took alot of time and energy. I had to change a lot of my written code to make it responsive and look good.
in addition to devtools, my boyfriend and my mother also got to look at the website via the live link in the mobile to help me find bugs, which has been very helpful.

* My biggest bug problems was to make the header responsive, I had to change my code almost compeletly for it to work and look good in any device. (Thank god for flexbox and why didn't I just use it in the beginning) 
* My second biggest bug problem was a huge margin space on the right when I resized the screen smaller. I was trying overflow:hidden and just did't get where the problem came from. Thanks to tutors help I found out it was my grid at the music section. The grid that I coded was not responsive and that takes us to my third biggest bug problem.
I had to rewrite this section many times until I find a very good tutorial at youtube that saved me.
* I got a fourth big bug problem too. The about section. My mentor wantet me to have everything on the site centered to make it look better. And in the beginning I had the about text floating left and a image floating at the right. To make it look good all centered I had to change and put the image at the start on top. And for it too look good I had to add more photos to make it almost like a gallery. And of course make it responsive. That part gave me a headache for hours until I find a really helpful tutorial again that solved my problem.
* Other than this three bug problems, I had alot of problems with the height of my sections. When resized it to smaller screen the content in the sections got hidden behind the next sections. Thanks to Devtool, after many hours of head scrathing I found the problem and It was finally completed in both bigger screens and the absolut smallest.
