# Project Description 

<p>This project have I developed for my brother, who is the main character for this website and the person behind "Wizack Twizack". He is a Psytrance musician and i thought it would be a good idea to make a website for him, where all of his information is gathered in one place and therefore easier for his listeners and possibly future producers to get a picture of him as a music creator.

This project is developed as my first Milestone project assignment at the Code Institute course I take. I chose to build my project as a One-page scrolling website to make my content on the website more effective for the user experience.

# Features
This is a one-page scroll website where all information is on one page, but divided into different sections.
## Existing Features
* <b>Header and Navigation Bar</b>
  * Placed at the top with a logo on the left with a link that takes the user to the home page when clicked on. To the right is a navigation bar that takes the user to the various sections of the website
  * Full responsive
* <b>The Hero Section</b>
  * This section is what the user first encounters when entering the page. It shows a photo of the musician's latest album that zooms in for 5 seconds.
  * Just below is a text that describes what you see, along with two buttons below that will link the user to two different places where you can listen or buy the album that opens in a new window.
* <b>About section</b>
  * The about section provides the user with information about who the website is about along with photos of the main character. 
  * Below the text about the main character, there is a button linked to the contact form on the website to be able to quickly fill in the form if you as a user are interested in getting in touch to, for example, book for future gigs.
* <b>Music Section</b>
  * This section contains clickable images on his album, where each album can be clicked on and you will come to a new page where you can choose where you want to stream the album. Under each picture, it says what the album is called and what year they were released. As well as a text that explains that there is more music to listen to, on his music services.
  * There is an embedded media player from Spotify with his 10 most played songs at the bottom of the section that can be listened to directly on the website.
* <b>Event Section</b>
  * This section is for listing the upcoming dates he will be playing on and I chose to do them with a form. It easily shows where and when.
  * The background is a map of Europe as it is in Europe that his gigs would be, to give the user a sense of what the section wants to give for information to the user
  * A text box with information about Covid and current circumstances under the event list. As we do not know yet if the gigs will take place.
* <b>Contact Section</b>
  * A form to easily contact Wizack Twizack with general questions or for future bookings. Where the user is required to fill in the name and email address, as well as their question and then click submit. 
* <b>Footer</b>
  * At the bottom is the footer. Contains icons for all social media Wizack Twizack is on. Clicking on an icon opens a new tab on the selected social media. Easy for the user to follow him on these social media and stay up to date.
  * Also an email address if you as a user prefer to send a regular email instead of the form. Along with a copywright icon that shows that the content on the website may not be used for external use.
* <b>Top button</b>
  * I have chosen to put a "Back to Top" button in the bottom right corner. As the website is a one-page scroll website, it makes it easier for the user to easily get to the menu quickly, instead of scrolling.
## Features Left to Implement
* In the Music Section, I wanted to put a media player under each album that the user can play the music directly via the website instead of just clicking and opening in the new tab. 
* Also in the Music Section, I was planning to make a carousel for the albums. But because I have not yet learned much about javascript, it had to be a grid with the album instead.
