<p>This project have I developed for my brother, who is the main character for this website and the person behind "Wizack Twizack". He is a Psytrance musician and i thought it would be a good idea to make a website for him, where all of his information is gathered in one place and therefore easier for his listeners and possibly future producers to get a picture of him as a music creator.

This project is developed as my first Milestone project assignment at the Code Institute course I take.
